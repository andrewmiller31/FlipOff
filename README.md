# Flip Off
The code of the puzzle logic for my app in the Play Store, "Flip Off - Tile Flipping Puzzle"

# How the Game Works
Each puzzle starts with an arbitrary grid of tiles. Each tile has an 'on' and 'off' state and the state can change in two ways:

1. The tile is clicked

2. One of the surrounding tiles is clicked

The puzzle is considered solved when all of the all the states of the tiles match a predetermined goal state.

#### UPDATE 7/13/2021
The app is unfortunately no longer in the Play Store. For those who come across this and are interested, I will eventually upload an .apk that can manually be installed.
